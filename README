=== What is it?

It's git. All the hard work was done in Grit (http://github.com/mojombo/grit or a
fork thereof) but I wanted something Å±ber simple, that at least supports basic workflow

So the idea is:

# All the following return true / false for success / failure
PebbleDash.init("/path/to/git/repo")

git = PebbleDash.new("/path/to/git/repo/dir/or/.git")


git.add("/path/to/add") # or "path/one", "path/two"
git.commit("My Commit Message")
git.push("origin master")

git.pull("origin master")


# Other neat bits

git.log("HEAD..HEAD^^^").each_file do |sha, msg, file|
  puts "in #{sha}, #{file.name} was #{file.change_type}ed because  "
end
# (or something like thst)

Oh, and any of the above commands with an exclaimation mark (e.g. pull!)  will
throw exceptions instead of just true/false.


=== Hasn't this all been done before?

Probably. I'm most likely being dense. Please let me know if that's the case...
