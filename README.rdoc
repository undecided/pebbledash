= Pebbledash - Grit, but a little nicer!

* http://github.com/undecided/pebbledash

== DESCRIPTION:

Pebbledash is all about simplicity. You use pebbledash much like you would use
git, except you get things back in a slightly nicer format.

All the hard work was done in Grit (http://github.com/mojombo/grit or a
fork thereof) but I wanted something Å±ber simple, that at least supports basic workflow


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Not many features yet. We're working on it though...

== SYNOPSIS:

=== Short-term desired synopsis:

# These would retern a Pebbledash instance or throw an exception
@git = Pebbledash.clone('git://github.com/undecided/pebbledash.git')

@git = Pebbledash.init('folder') # Create a new git repository

@git = Pebbledash.new('dir') # Use one that's already checked out

# The usual commands:
@git.add('file1', 'file2') # Stage these files

@git.commit('My really descriptive message') # Add a message

@git.push


=== Longer-term desired synopsis:

@git = Pebbledash.new('dir', 'origin/master') # Throw exception if not a git

@git.log([flexible parameters])


=== Acheived Synopsis:

None of the above!!


== REQUIREMENTS:

* Some kind of grit

== INSTALL:

* Gem from github? Maybe?
